Jayme Ray Pyne is a singer-songwriter from the woods of Michigan, writing and recording songs out of San Jose, California. He writes in the country and Americana genres, offering lyrics meditating on the joy and suffering of everyday life amidst the search for spiritual awakening and inner peace.
Pyne’s debut solo album, Remembrance, is a nine-track homage to his father, an unknown yet talented country music singer from rural Michigan. Jayme Ray’s father influenced his early tastes for music by spinning dusty old records from the likes Conway Twitty, Hank Williams, and Credence Clearwater Revival. Pyne’s father also inadvertently awakened in him a folk wisdom, similar to the tenets of Zen Buddhism, offering a path to equanimity through acceptance of life as it unfolds.
Remembrance chronicles the many ways of experiencing loss and redemption, with stories of weathering the turmoil of fading romantic relationships, intergenerational family trauma, death, and the constant struggle between the psyche’s inner voices and the human spirit. 
“Let Your Light Show” is a modernistic country-styled anthem with rhythmic sensibilities harkening to Tom Petty. Lyrics relate the burden of internalized social pressure and its effects, when heeded, on living an authentic, meaningful life.
“Can I Go Home” is a foot-stomping hoedown-style track recounting the ambivalence of being displaced far from home—only to realize that true home is simply the refuge of a quiet mind.

“Missed Roads” offers a stripped down, melancholic folk rumination of lost opportunities, second-guessing, and regret.

“Phoenix” at times channels both George Strait and Roy Orbison, telling the story of a moment in which acting upon a life-changing move would most certainly end in divorce.

“The Fire Lights the Flame” is a grandiose country piano ballad relating the feeling of pure spiritual awakening.

Remembrance will be released through most streaming services, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music on July 20, 2024.
